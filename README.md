# universal_chromatin_hmm

Universal chromatin HMMs (now superseeded by ChroMATIC)

# About

This is a repository of analysis scripts for Hidden Markov Modelling of chromatin states, as used in Manon et al (in revision).

> **Warning** These scripts are the distant forerunners of **ChroMATIC**, a complete gaussian Chromatin HMM analysis package that provides fully-automated analysis, machine-learning assignment of chromatin states, multi-modal inference and more.
>
> Please see our [preprint on biorXiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.30.514435v1.abstract) for more details.
>
> The full source code of ChroMATIC will be released upon publication, but if you're interested in using ChroMATIC before this, please email Owen Marshall directly.
